SoC operates a number of UNIX servers where students can login and interactively
develop programs in the UNIX environment.  We will be accessing SoC's \sunfire\
server from the PCs in the programming lab.  Use your NUSNET account to login to
the PC in the programming lab.

\section{What is UNIX?} %{{{
UNIX is the name of the operating system developed by a group of AT\&T
researchers at Bell Labs in 1969.  Most modern operating systems, such as Linux,
Solaris, Mac OS X, and BSD (see Figure \ref{fig:modern}), descended from UNIX.
All of these operating systems provide a UNIX-like environment to the user. 

\begin{frame}
\ftitle{Modern UNIX}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{unix_logos}\end{center}
\caption{Modern UNIX-like operating systems (Linux, BSD, Solaris)}
\label{fig:modern}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

SoC's \sunfire\ server runs on the Solaris operating system developed by Sun
Microsystem.  

UNIX is more than just a family operating systems. It also an approach towards
software that emphasizes creating small sharp tools that work well together.
This is embodied in the UNIX philosophy.   

\begin{frame}{The UNIX Philosophy}
\begin{quote}
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

Write programs to work together.

Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

\end{figure}
\end{frame}

In the next activity, we will connect to the \sunfire\ server (see Figure
\ref{fig:sunfire}) and access the UNIX system via the Secure Shell protocol
(ssh).

\begin{frame}{Activity: Connecting to \sunfire}
\begin{enumerate}
\item From the desktop, launch the \texttt{SSH Secure Shell Client} application. 
\item Click on \texttt{Quick Connect}\\ 
Host Name: \texttt{sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg}\\ 
User Name: your UNIX user name
\mode<presentation>{

\item Click on \texttt{Connect}.
\item Click on ``Yes'' at the next dialog.  
\item Enter your UNIX password in the password dialog.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

Once you have logged in, you will see a command line interface.

\section{Text editing} %{{{

Types of files you will encounter on UNIX include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item a document (report, essay etc.)
\item the text of a program written in some high-level programming language
\item instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible 
to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable or 
binary file)
\item a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a 
mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files.
\end{itemize}

Text files are used extensively on a UNIX system for storing system data,
program configuration files, scripts and source code. They are preferable to
binary files because they can be easily read/modified.  The most important
program is a text editor, a program to interactively create/edit text files.
Examples of editors on UNIX are Vim, Emacs, nano, and pico. 

\begin{frame}
\ftitle{Text files are ubiquitous on UNIX}

Technology from President Clinton.}
\label{fig:medal}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

The first version of UNIX was developed by Ken Thompson in August of 1969,
supposedly in just three week. In 1971, Dennis Ritchie invented the C
programming language and UNIX was rewritten using C and became the first
operating system to be written in a high level language. Most operating systems
of the time, including the original UNIX, was written in assembly language,
which was a special language that is unique to a particular type of hardware.
After UNIX was rewritten in C, it was possible to run UNIX on many different
types of hardware.     

For the development and implementation of UNIX and their contributions to
operating systems theory, Dennis and Ken were jointly awarded the A. M. Turing
award in 1983 and the National Medal of Technology (Figure \ref{fig:medal}) in
1999. The A. M. Turing award is the equivalent of the Nobel prize in Computer
Science.

\end{frame}

An OS is the software that is in charge of scheduling resources and processes 
of a system as well as managing and maintaining interactivity between the
software and hardware of the system. Figure \ref{fig:os} shows that the
operating system acts as the bridge between your applications and the computer
hardware.  
\section{UNIX Concepts}
UNIX consists of the following components:
\begin{description}
\item[Kernel] The kernel of UNIX is the core of the operating system. It
allocates time and memory to programs and handles the file system and
communications in response to system calls.  
\item[Shell] The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel.
When a user logs in, the login program checks the user name and password, and
then starts another program called the shell.   The shell is a command line
interpreter. It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them
to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate,
the shell gives the user another prompt.  
\item[Files and processes] Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process.  A
process is an executing program identified by a unique process identifier.  A
file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors,
running compilers etc.
\item[Utilities] An operating system is useless without useful applications that
help the you to accomplish everyday tasks such as editing text, browsing the web
etc.  A UNIX-like environment provides a standard set of useful utilities.  
\end{description}

% vim history
% vim is a modal editor, command mode and insert mode
In this workshop, we will introduce you to the Vim editor.  Vim stands for Vi
IMproved, it is created by Bram Moolenaar (now working at Google) as an
improvement of an earlier editor called vi by Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun
Microsystems).  Vim is a modal editor. This means, depending on the current
mode, different keys have different effects (see Figure \ref{fig:vim_modes}).  
For example in Normal mode, pressing `x' key deletes the character under the
cursor, while in Insert mode, it adds the character `x' to the text file. This
allows Vim to use almost all the keys on your keyboard for issuing commands.

\section{Some useful applications on UNIX}
A major part of the operating system that the user interacts with are the
utilities that helps the user to perform everyday tasks such as editing files,
printing and reading email.     

You have already used a number of such utilities such as \texttt{mkdir} (make
directory), \texttt{mv} (move), \texttt{chmod} (change modifiers/permissions)
and \texttt{cd} (change directory).

In the next activity, you will learn a number of utilities related to printing.
There are a number of printers that are exclusive to SoC students, they are
located in COM1 level 1 and basement.  

% ACTIVITY: Printing

\begin{itemize}
\item View the status of the print queue, use \texttt{lpq}, \cmd{lpq -P pstsc}
\item Remove a print job after it has been sent, use \texttt{lprm}, \cmd{lprm -P pstsc 89}
\item Check your print quota, use \texttt{pusage}, \cmd{pusage}
\end{itemize}

If there is additional time during the workshop, you may wish to setup a
homepage which is accessible at \url{http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~unix_user name}.
The details are provided in the following activity.  

% ACTIVITY: setting up index.html
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Activity: Setting up your homepage (Optional)}
Instead of using \texttt{hello.txt}, create a file named \texttt{index.html} and
put it in your \texttt{public\_html} directory. Remember to change its
permissions to readable by all.  

\begin{verbatim}
<html>
<head>
<title>Sample index page</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello World
</body>
</html>
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\section{Organising your home directory}
Files on UNIX are arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree
(see Figure \ref{fig:dir}).  The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called
root (written as a slash /)

Directories allow you to organising your files on UNIX.  Certain directories
have special meaning in UNIX. For example, the contents of the directory named
\texttt{public\_html} in your home directory is interpreted by the web server as
your homepage at \url{http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~unix_user name}

Sometimes you might want to share a file with your friends but it is too large
to send through email. You can make use of the 2Gb in your UNIX account to host
the file on your website.
