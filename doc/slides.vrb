\frametitle {Activity: Setting up your homepage (Optional)}
Instead of using \texttt{hello.txt}, create a file named \texttt{index.html} and
put it in your \texttt{public\_html} directory. Remember to change its
permissions to readable by all.

\begin{verbatim}
<html>
<head>
<title>Sample index page</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello World
</body>
</html>
\end{verbatim}
