Creating UNIX account before UWS
From experience, the creation of UNIX account is one of the most time
consuming parts of the workshop, to save time the freshmen should do this
BEFORE coming to UWS.

Action by Ting Ting
  a) to email the URL to freshies to tell them to create their UNIX account before Unix Workshop or they can wait for their GLs to help them. URL is https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct/
  b) to ask GLs to help freshies to create their unix account during CORS bidding

How UNIX will be used in the coming sem
We decided that the main theme of the workshop is to cover some basic UNIX
skills to prepare freshmen to use UNIX in their modules. To do this we first
need to find out what the freshman will be using UNIX for in the introductory
modules. 

The assignment of modules to check is as follows (there are some small changes
due to clashes in the original assignment):
  Melvin: CS1010
  Khoa: CS1020
  An Hoa: CS2020
  Perry: CG1101
  Saiaswin: CG1103

You can get info about the course from http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/useful_course_schedule.html

Please find out how UNIX will be used this coming sem. Specifically, we want
to find out what students will use UNIX for (aka use cases) in the
respective module, i.e. to write/edit programs, to compile and test programs,
to do their labs/PE, etc

Main activites during UWS
Tentatively, we have decided to focus on the following two activities:
  a) text editing with nano (introduction to basic text editing on UNIX)
  b) using diff/grep (introduction to tools like diff/grep which makes it easier to check the output of lab programs)
We have also decided to replace some of the materials in the current version of the notes.

Action by An Hoa
a) replace text editing with vim to text editing with nano
b) to create slides and notes by editing UNIX.tex and posting the updated file to the workspace by this Friday
c) UNIX.tex is at http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/unix_workshop/trunk/doc/UNIX.tex

Action by Jialong
a) replace the "sunfire as a webhost" activity with an introduction
   to diff/grep, with the intention that these tools can help to simplify the
   checking of program output against expected output (useful for labs)
b) to create slides and notes by editing UNIX.tex and posting the updated file to the workspace by this Friday
c) UNIX.tex is at http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/unix_workshop/trunk/doc/UNIX.tex

Action by Khoa
a) replace "GUI vs CLI" set of slides and an introduction to CLI, covering
   concepts like programs are executing by typing their name instead of clicking
   their icon, concept of command line arguments, silence is golden principle of
   UNIX (no output means everything worked correctly, no need to be concerned)
b) to create slides/notes in powerpoint and create a zip with powerpoint and images used, upload to workspace by Friday

Action by Melvin
a) to make all other changes to improve the flow of the slides and remove the boring materials and integrate the updates
b) integrate changes to UNIX.tex and powerpoint from Khoa and upload updated slides/notes to workspace by Monday
