An Introduction to the <i>Sunfire</i> <br>
Programming Environment <br>

<h1>1 Introduction </h1>
<p>
This laboratory is designed to give you an introduction to the <i>sunfire</i>
Java programming environment, the environment which you will be working in
for your CS1101 practical sessions. This first lab session will also help
you to become familiar with logging into the <i>sunfire</i> UNIX machine,
manipulating and editing files in UNIX, compiling, and running a simple Java
program.
</p><p>

<a name="section2"></a>
</p><h1>2 Accessing <i>sunfire</i> </h1>
<p>
Two authentication procedures are needed to access <i>sunfire</i>. 
The following describes the steps from a typical laboratory PC.
</p><p>

<a name="section2_1"></a>
</p><h2>2.1 Logging into NUSNET </h2>
<p>
If you are reading this document on a PC in SoC, you are already logged into
NUSNET, in which case you may skip to 
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Ecs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/unix_intro.html#login_sunfire">2.2</a>.

</p><p>
SoC has many personal computers (PCs) located in various laboratories, 
classrooms, and offices. The PCs are networked within the
campus via the NUSNET local area network which is in turn connected to the
internet. Generally, these PCs run Windows XP as the sole operating system.
In order to use any of these machines, you need to authenticate yourself to
the NUSNET server through a login process.

    <td align="left">
      If the PC is not on, switch it on. You should be greeted with a 
      Windows screen. As instructed on the screen, press 
      <b>Ctrl-Alt-Delete</b>.
    </td>
  </tr>

</p><p>
All NUS students are issued with the NUSNET account by the Computer Centre.
The domain name (ie. suffix) of this account is <tt>@nus.edu.sg</tt>. 
<!--
Note that your NUSNET user-id is different from your matriculation number, 
although they curiously share the same format. 
-->
Use the NUSNET account to identify yourself to the NUSNET server:

    </td>
    <td align="left">
       When a login screen appears, type in your <b>NUSNET user-id</b>, 
       your <b>NUSNET password</b>, and <b>select the NUSSTU domain</b>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>
Note that user-ids and passwords are case-sensitive, and that passwords
should <i>never</i> appear on your screen as you type them (the characters
should be replaced with asterisks). So type slowly and carefully. Make sure
"CapsLock" is off. If you use the numeric pad keys, make sure "NumLock" is
on.

</p><p>
After you have logged into NUSNET, you should see the familiar Windows XP
desktop, icons, and taskbar. You can now execute Windows programs that have
been installed in the machine. For example, you can access the internet
using Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE).

CS1101 students (that includes CS1101X, Y and Z) students will be doing
programming in Windows, but in order
to have our SoC students properly acquainted with advanced (and arguably
superior) operating systems, I would like you to also learn about
the UNIX operating system on <i>sunfire</i> and do your programming
in that environment.

</p><h2>2.2 Logging (ssh) into <i>sunfire</i> </h2>
<p>
In addition to your NUSNET account, all SoC students, as well as students
from other faculties taking SoC modules, are issued with an SoC UNIX
account. The domain name of the SoC account is <tt>@comp.nus.edu.sg</tt>. 
Note that for non-SoC students, the SoC UNIX account created for your 
course are purged at the end of the semester. Do not mix up your SoC 
account with your NUSNET account - they are <i>not</i> interchangeable.

</p><p>
Use your SoC UNIX account for logging into <i>sunfire</i>, or other 
UNIX machines in SoC. The <i>sunfire</i>, in particular, is a multiuser 
machine residing in the SoC machine room (on S15 ground floor, hidden
from view). That means many students can simultaneously work in the
machine at the same time. One way of accessing <i>sunfire</i> is to start a
remote shell (also known as command prompt in Windows) where you can perform
tasks and execute programs on <i>sunfire</i> without having to be physically 
at the machine. This is known as a client-server relationship - your remote
shell is the client and <i>sunfire</i> is the server. Start your shell client 
as follows:

</p><h1>3 Common UNIX commands </h1>
<p>
When in the UNIX shell, you might find that there is a lot of typing and not
much mouse clicking, which may be little different from the graphical
user-interfaces (GUI) you are used to. A little primitive? Perhaps. That's
where we'll start and we'll get to the fancy stuff later.

</p><p>
Within the shell window, basically here's what happens: you are presented
with a prompt awaiting your command; You type a command, press enter, and
the shell program interprets and checks if the command is valid. If it is,
the corresponding program or utility is invoked, otherwise a error message
is displayed. The shell then awaits your next command.

</p><p>
For instance, suppose you wish to know the current date and time, you may
simply issue the <tt>date</tt> command.

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">

    <td align="left">

  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[24]$ date
Mon Jul 18 22:39:35 GMT-8 2005
</pre>

<p>
On the other hand, if the command you typed is invalid, the shell complains
with a "Command not found" error message.

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      <b>Type some nonsense</b> and watch the system snide back at you.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[25]$ asdfasdf
bash: asdfasdf: command not found
stutest@sf3:~[26]$
</pre>

<p>
The following subsections are a few commonly used commands. This list is by
no means exhaustive but it'll suffice for now. In time you will learn to be
familiar with these commands and many more. Do note that UNIX commands are
case-sensitive.

</p><p>
<a name="section3_1"></a>
</p><h2>3.1 <tt>echo, cat, &gt;, », &lt;</tt> </h2>
<p>
<tt>echo</tt> is a typical UNIX command - a single-worded instruction to be
followed by a number of parameters, each separated by one or more spaces.
You type the command and its parameters into the UNIX shell, hit enter, and
it gives a reply which usually also signals the completion of the command. Like
so:

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      Try this:
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[82]$ echo "Hello there"
Hello there
stutest@sf3:~[83]$
</pre>

<p>
In this case, the <tt>echo</tt> command simply "prints" whatever parameters you
typed after the <tt>echo</tt> command. Note that the double-quotes were not
printed. The double-quotes simply indicate that we wish to treat <tt>"Hello
there"</tt> as a single string parameter. What if the double-quotes are not
there? 

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      Try these examples and reason the results you see:
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[84]$ echo Hello there
stutest@sf3:~[85]$ echo Hello              there
stutest@sf3:~[86]$ echo "Hello\nthere"
</pre>

<p>
In that last example, the special character <tt>"\n"</tt> is a
newline character to indicate that whatever output that follows should begin
on a new line. In the first two examples, the two words <tt>"Hello"</tt> and
<tt>"there"</tt> were treated as two parameters; and it didn't matter how many
spaces separates them.

</p><p>
Later, when you begin writing Java programs, you will find that there is
often a need to create test data for the programs you write. Here's a simple
way to create simple a test data file:

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
       Create this single-lined data file:
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[87]$ echo "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." &gt; fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[88]$
</pre>

<p>
Unlike the previous executions of <tt>echo</tt>, this time we didn't get any
reply. So where did the string go? Answer: into a file named <tt>"fox.dat"</tt>.
The <tt>"&gt;"</tt> character redirects the output of the preceding command 
into a named file. How do you know it's there? Use the <tt>"cat"</tt> command 
to display the entire contents of a file (usually text file)
to the shell window:

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      Printing (to screen) the contents of a text file:
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[88]$ cat fox.dat
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
stutest@sf3:~[89]$
</pre>

<p>
Want to append more lines to the data file? Use the double-redirect:

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      Appending lines to an existing file:
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[90]$ echo "While it sleeps." &gt;&gt; fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[91]$ echo "While it sleeps." &gt;&gt; fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[92]$ echo "While it sleeps." &gt;&gt; fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[93]$ cat fox.dat
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
While it sleeps.
While it sleeps.
While it sleeps.
</pre>
<p>
Likewise, the "&lt;" character redirects input from a file.
For an example, see
<a href="#section9_3">9.3</a>.

</p><p>
<a name="section3_2"></a>
</p><h2>3.2 <tt>history</tt> </h2>
<p>
Your UNIX shell keeps track of a "history" of the commands you typed. To
repeat a command, you can simply hit the "arrow up" key.

<table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img ilo-full-src="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/images/do_it.gif" src="do_it.gif" alt="do_it.gif" align="middle">
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      Try the arrow-up key to append more lines to the data file.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>
The history of commands is cleared each time a new shell is started. If
you're interested to see a list of the history, simply type <tt>history</tt>:
</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[93]$ history
   78  echo hello
   79  echo hello there
   80  echo
   81  which echo
   82  echo Hello there
   83  echo "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." &gt; fox.dat 
   84  cat fox.dat
   85  echo "While it sleeps." &gt;&gt; fox.dat
   86  echo "While it sleeps." &gt;&gt; fox.dat
   87  echo "While it sleeps." &gt;&gt; fox.dat
   88  cat fox.dat
   90  h

</p><h2>3.3 <tt>ls</tt> </h2>
<p>
The workspace in your UNIX account is compartmentalized into directories
(also known as folders in Windows). The directory where you start from
whenever you open a UNIX shell is known as your "home directory".
At this point you should have at least one file in your home directory - 
<tt>"fox.dat"</tt> which we have just created. To check that it is indeed 
there, or just to see what other files you have, use the <tt>"ls"</tt> 
(list directory contents) command:

The last command list the directory contents in "long" format. It lists the
file type and permissions 
(see <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Ecs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/unix_intro.html#unix_chmod">3.7</a>), ownership information, 
and date and time the file was last modified.

Sometimes a directory contains "hidden" files - these are files beginning
with a <tt>"."</tt> character. To list them, use the <tt>"-a"</tt> option 
to <tt>ls</tt>.

documentation. These pages are known as man (manual) pages and you use the

<p>
If the man page spans more than one screen space, the display is
automatically paginated - press "f" (or "space") to scroll down and "b" to
scroll back.

</p><p>
In case you do not know the exact command name, you can query the man pages
by keyword. For example, to list commands which manipulate directories (see
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Ecs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/unix_intro.html#unix_cd">3.5</a>), you could do this:

The directories of a UNIX filesystem is organized as a huge hierarchical
tree. If a directory <tt>B</tt> is residing in a directory <tt>A</tt>, 
<tt>B</tt> is said to be the subdirectory of <tt>A</tt>, <tt>A</tt> the 
parent directory of <tt>B</tt>, and we write <tt>"A/B"</tt> to indicate 
this relationship. Each directory may contain any number of 
files/subdirectories, but each file/directory must have a unique parent 
directory.

<a name="section3_7"></a>
<a name="unix_chmod"></a>
</p><h2>3.7 <tt>chmod</tt> </h2> 
<p>
Access to files and directories is controlled in UNIX using access
permissions. UNIX allows three levels of access for different categories of
users:

</p><ul>
  <li><tt>r</tt> for read, <tt>w</tt> for write and <tt>x</tt> for execute.
</li></ul>

<p>
separately for

</p><ul>
  <li>yourself (<tt>u</tt>), a group of users (<tt>g</tt>), 
      other users (<tt>o</tt>) or everybody (<tt>a</tt>).
</li></ul>

<p>
Access permissions can be viewed using the <tt>ls -l</tt> command (See
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Ecs1101x/3_ca/labs/lab0/unix_intro.html#unix_ls">3.3</a>) and UNIX allows you, if you 
own a file, to set file permissions.

</p><p>
In the CS1101 student account, when a file is created the permissions are
set by default so that only you have read and write access to the file.
Default access permissions can be changed (see <tt>man umask</tt>). 
If you want to arrange for everyone ("<tt>a</tt>") to also be able to 
read ("<tt>+r</tt>") the file, the <tt>chmod</tt> ('change mode') command 
sets the necessary access permission:

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[228]$ echo "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." &gt; fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[229]$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-------   1 stutest  soc05         45 Aug 16 18:45 fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[230]$ chmod a+r fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[231]$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r--   1 stutest  soc05         45 Aug 16 18:45 fox.dat
</pre>

<p>
As shown, user <tt>stutest</tt> is under the UNIX group <tt>soc05</tt> and
therefore the files he creates has that group name.
To withdraw the read access from all 'others' but yourself, use <tt>chmod
go-r</tt>:
</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[240]$ chmod go-r fox.dat
stutest@sf3:~[241]$ ls -l 
total 16
-rw-------   1 stutest  soc05         45 Aug 16 18:47 fox.dat
drwx------   2 stutest  soc05         96 Aug 16 15:39 hole
</pre>

<p>
Access rights on directories are a little different; read access means that
the owner, group, or everyone can read the names of the files in the
directory (ie. able to <tt>ls</tt> the directory), write means that they can
change the directory, ie. can create and remove files in it and eXecute
access means that they can <tt>cd</tt> to it, ie. can make this directory 
their current directory. It is common for directory access to be 
<tt>drwxr-xr-x</tt>; <tt>x</tt> access is harmless but it is very dangerous 
to give <tt>w</tt> access on a directory to the group or other.

</p><p>
The command <tt>chmod</tt> also sets access permissions on directories. For
example to remove all permissions from group and others on your home
directory:
</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[242]$ chmod go-rwx ~
</pre>

<p>
Group ownership of files and directories can also be changed. Access
permissions can also be set numerically and some may find this easier. See
<tt>man chmod</tt> for these details and more.

</p><p>
<a name="section3_8"></a>
</p><h2>3.8 <tt>less</tt> </h2> 
<p>
As mentioned above, you can use the <tt>cat</tt> command to display the
contents of a text file. However, if the file is big (spans more than one
screen space), you'll find that a command that paginates the file as you
read it is more helpful.

    BlueJ is a simple integrated development environment for Java created
    at Monash University and the University of Southern Denmark for use
    in teaching elementary computer programming.  It is free and easy to
    use.  BlueJ and its documentation may be downloaded from the BlueJ
    web page "http://www.bluej.org".  The current version of BlueJ
    requires that the Sun Java Development Kit J2SE 1.3 or higher be
    installed on your computer.  This is available at the Java web page
    "http://java.sun.com".

</p><h2>3.13 Controlling processes: <tt>ctrl-z, jobs, fg, bg</tt> </h2>
<p>
In UNIX, besides terminating processes, you can also interactively control
the execution status of a program. For example, pressing <tt>ctrl-z</tt>
suspends the currently running program in your shell:

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[525]$ less ~cs1101/stu/bluej.txt
...
   &lt; ctrl-z pressed by user &gt;
[1]+  Stopped                 less ~cs1101/stu/bluej.txt
stutest@sf3:~[530]$ jobs
[1]+  Stopped                 less ~cs1101/stu/bluej.txt
</pre>

<p>
While the program is suspended you can run other programs, for instance,
type <tt>jobs</tt> tells you what processes are stopped. To resume the process,
type <tt>fg</tt>. If you have more than one process stopped, type <tt>fg</tt>
followed by the job number as listed by <tt>jobs</tt>. To put the process in
the background, type <tt>bg</tt>.

</p><p>
Suspending and resuming jobs can be really helpful in programming. For
example, while editing a program, you can suspend the editor for a moment to
compile or run your program, and then resume the editor at the point where
you left off to continue your programming.

</p><h2>3.14 Changing password </h2> 
<p>
You can change your password as often as you like; in fact, you are advised
to change it regularly. 
You may change your password via mySoC at the following URL:
<a href="https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/%7Emyacct/" target="_&quot;_blank&quot;">https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~myacct/</a>. 
Or you may use this command: <tt>/usr/bin/passwd</tt>. 
You will be prompted for the old (existing) password and then the new
password (twice). 

</p><p>
Choose a password that is 6 to 8 characters long. There are guidelines to
choosing good passwords which are safer and less susceptible to break-ins.
When you change your password, the system will check that your new password
satisfies its stringent requirements, failing which it will reject the
change. Generally, the system tends to accept passwords that consist of at
least a mix of upper-case and lower-case characters, plus some digits.

<p>
When you have finished, you must always log out of the computer system as
follows:

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~/c[224]$ logout
</pre>

<p>
Typing "<tt>exit</tt>" or pressing <tt>ctrl-d</tt> will also have the 
same effect.
The <tt>ctrl-d</tt> signals an End-Of-File (EOF) which in this case ends the
input to the shell. This can accidentally knock you out of your shell if
you're not careful. To modify the behavior of <tt>ctrl-d</tt>, try 
(you will have to <tt>ctrl-d</tt> 3 times to exit):
</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[501]$ export IGNOREEOF=2
</pre>

<p>
In any case, you MUST remember to log out, otherwise anyone who comes by 
may delete all your valuable files away!

</p><p>
Similarly, if you find that someone has forgotten to logoff, just graciously
log out for him or her. Do a <tt>whoami</tt> and send the user a polite note.
Don't even think of malice.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to access your UNIX files from your local

<p>
There are a number of text editors available in <i>sunfire</i>: 
vi, vim, emacs, joe, pico, nano, etc. The more powerful one requires 
a longer time to learn. For this lab, you will use the simplest 
editor of all - pico. Equivalently, you may use nano, which is an 
open-source variant of pico enhanced with programmer-friendly features 
such as syntax-highlighting and multiple-buffers etc.

The status line at the top of the display shows the program's version, the
current file being edited and whether or not there are outstanding
modifications that have not been saved. The third line from the bottom is
used to report informational messages and for additional command input. The
bottom two lines list the available editing commands. Each character typed
is automatically inserted into the buffer at the current cursor position.
Editing commands and cursor movement (besides arrow keys) are given to pico
by typing special control-key sequences. A caret, '^', is used to denote
the control key, sometimes marked "CTRL", so the CTRL-q key combination is
written as ^Q.

</p><h2>6.2 <tt>alias</tt>ing frequently used commands </h2>
<p>
Obviously, it is quite a hassle to have to type "<tt>~cs1101/stu/bin/nano</tt>" whenever you need to invoke the editor, something
which you will do very often. We need a short-cut to it. One way to do so is
to define an "alias" to the command.

</p><p>
For example, suppose you do "<tt>ls -l</tt>" very often. It would be nice to
define a short-cut, such as "<tt>ll</tt>" which does the same but saves you a
few keystrokes:

<table cellpadding="3">

    <td align="center">

      Define an alias for "<tt>ls -l</tt>" as follows:
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><pre>stutest@sf3:~[425]$ alias ll='ls -l'
</pre>

<p>
Now, whenever you issue the command "<tt>ll</tt>" in your shell, it would 
be as if you had typed "<tt>ls -l</tt>", ie. "<tt>ll</tt>" is now an 
alias for "<tt>ls -l</tt>". Try it. 

</p><p>
Still, it would be even better if this alias is automatically set up
whenever you start your UNIX shell. The way to do that is to put the alias
command into the <tt>.profile</tt> file in your home directory
. The <tt>.profile</tt> file is the initialization file of your shell.

At this point you might want to put <tt>nedit</tt> into the background (see

windows, you can reserve the shell window for Java compilation or execution.

</p><p>
You may choose to use <tt>nedit</tt> to do your CS1101 programming if you wish,
bearing in mind any bandwidth constraints that you may have (ie. don't try
this at home). Using <tt>nedit</tt> should be easy enough and I'll leave it to
you to figure it out.

</p><h1>9 More practice </h1>
<p>
The following are a few simple Java programs with parts of it missing (the
underlined portions). You should try to understand the codes and fill in the
blanks, type (or cut and paste) them into your chosen editor, and try out
the compilation and execution process.

</p><p>
As you might not have known much about Java yet, you may come back to
attempt the exercises here later.

</p><p>
You are reminded that your .java filename must correspond to the public
class name in the file.
